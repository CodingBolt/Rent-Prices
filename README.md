# Rent-Prices
This code scrapes data from Daft.ie. It takes a user input of the area(s) to
search and then returns all properties in that area. It saves this data to a
s/sheet of the users descretion. Each area is given a seperate tab named after
the area in question. 
The code then takes user input of how many beds. Using this information it
coallates the price information across all areas searched into a new tab 
called 'Table-Data'. It then calculates the average price for each area by
printing simple excel formulas to the 'Table-Data s/sheet'.
